    <h2>What is POha</h2><p>POHA=  The word Poha (plural: pohe) refers to 2 things â€“ the first one is the ingredient flattened rice itself and the second one is the Poha recipe or the dish that is made with this particular ingredient. Easy to remember, make and tastes fab. No confusions there, right?

        As mentioned above, both the ingredient and dish are a super common feature in Maharashtra, as well as then neighboring Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Goa too.
        
        It even reaches the south in Karnataka and Telangana, north in Rajasthan and east in West Bengal and Odisha. The dish is also consumed as a snack in these states.</p>
